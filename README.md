### What this project is about 

This is a beginner project done while following along with Udemy's "Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D"

#### List of prefabs
- Car.prefab - This looks a bit weird (of course) but it does look like a car. Essentially blocks + cylinders
- Divider.prefab - This is kinda designed to look like a gas station sign but is essentially a divider. A combo of cube + cylinder + capsule. 
- StreetLight.prefab - This is a combo of cyclinders and a capsule.
